The Computer Science and Engineering programme at VIT-AP is a unique blend of hardware and software,
 allowing students to gain knowledge about the concepts that enable many of todayâ€™s fundamental technologies, 
including Wireless Communication and the Internet of Things.

The initial level courses provide students with a core foundation in programming, mathematical reasoning, physics, and circuit design.
 The latter part blends fundamentals in computer science including software engineering, database management system, computer networks, operating systems, and
 computer architecture with fundamentals in electrical engineering including digital logic design and embedded systems.

Elective courses allow students to specialize in advanced areas of computer science. In this programme, you will gain hands-on experience 
in the theory and application of computing, as well as practical experience through Engineering Clinics, Capstone Project, and Internship. 
Students pursuing computer science courses will acquire knowledge of the design, implementation, and management of information systems of both hardware and software.
 You will, further, learn to use computing and information technology to help solve existing and potential real-world problems that we face in business, science, and society.
